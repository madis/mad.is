GALT begun as a solution to a problem I had. When travelling I wanted to meet up with other freedom-minded people. It was burdensome and sometimes impossible to find local groups and meetups on all different social media and communication platforms. Some other issues I encountered were registration processes that require too much private information and the difficulty to keep in contact.

GALT is open source and available at [GALT Github repository](https://github.com/galt-network/galt/).

The web page is at [https://galt.is](https://galt.is)

## Features

## Features (existing and upcoming)

  - Anonymity (if you want). You can provide the data about yourself that you want or stay completely anonymous
  - Don't reinvent the wheel. It doesn't try to compete with existing successful communication platforms
    like Signal, Telegram, Mastodon or others, rather it is here to help like-minded people find each other and for them to use the tools they're already accustomed to.
  - Decentralized. Although the initial version uses centralized application database, first on the roadmap is to integrate it with decentralized tools for storage (IPFS) and communication (Nostr), so that those who want can take their data with them.
  - Uncensorable. It's up to the groups and their members to decide the rules. No super-admin moderation.
  - Sound money. Groups can raise funds for their events or other activities in the best money humanity has invented so far - Bitcoin. No custody, your bitcoin is yours
  - Open source. Galt is open source. Feel free to use parts or the whole of it any way you see fit
